This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Welcome
This is my very own portfolio site that I've developed using React (as stated above). For now, I'm just elaborating further what happened based on the commit logs you see up top.

## Logs

### 22nd July 2020
The website is finally live. I've uploaded my files to github as well as set up the continuous deployment (courtesy of [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)) which now I only need to push to the default branch and Netlify will build the project and deploy it automatically. Netlify is perfect because it provides a serverless back-end services, which is perfect for a static site such as this for now as a lot of the stuff I'm posting I can just put it as a single .json file included in the project and just update the site from there. But this might change as time pass.

### 23rd July 2020
I've changed the logos of the website so that it doesn't use the default atomic icon that comes with every React app. With the help of Canva, and some inspiration from all the free logo generators out there, I've finally set on this logo:

I don't have a formal interpretation of the logo but it's simple and sophisticated.
