This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Welcome
This is my very own portfolio site that I've developed using React (as stated above). For now, I'm just elaborating further what happened based on the commit logs you see up top.

### 22th July 2020
I've uploaded my files to github as well as set up the continuous deployment (courtesy of [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)). Netlify is perfect because it provides a serverless back-end services, which is perfect for a static site such as this for now as a lot of the stuff I'm posting I can just put it as a single .json file included in the project and just update the site from there. But this might change as time pass.
